My name is Alejandro. I attend the University of Virginia, studying computer science. This is my first project in my journey to becoming a full-stack developer. 

My task was to recreate the classic Google search homepage using html and css only. I think I got pretty close, the only thing I couldn't figure out was how to add a second icon (rainbow mic) inside the search bar. I plan on coming back to fix that later on. 

In the process, I learned how to use Chrome's DevTools. I am proud of the fact that I only referenced the original page for the colors used.
